{"name":"Caloric Suitability Index","tagline":"Oded Galor and Ömer Özak","body":"=========================\r\nCaloric Suitability Index\r\n=========================\r\n\r\nThe **Caloric Suitability Indices** measure the caloric production potential based on agriculture for the Pre-1500CE and Post-1500CE eras as constructed by [Galor and Özak (2014)](https://ideas.repec.org/p/smu/ecowpa/1407.html). The data can be used to assess or account for the exogenous effect of agricultural potential on various economic and social outcomes. An [IPython notebook](https://github.com/ozak/Caloric-Suitability-Index/blob/master/notebooks/Caloric%20and%20Agricultural%20Suitability.ipynb) is included to show how it can be used and also compares it with another measure of agricultural suitability. The data is provided as a service to the academic research community (see license for permitted uses). \r\n\r\n=================================================\r\nDownload Options for Caloric Suitability Indices\r\n=================================================\r\n\r\nThe **Caloric Suitability Indices** can be downloaded as a zip file, or individually.
